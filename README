Orianne
=======

Orianne is a minimal FTP server running on Windows and UNIX flavours. It is self-contained and needs no setup.

Simply start it and it serves the current working directory read-only.

Orianne has been written in full C++ using boost. Currently, only VS2010 configuration files and binaries
are available. Unix makefiles are to be added soon.
